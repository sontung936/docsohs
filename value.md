**Difficulties currently faced by SocialFi**

a) Only important assets (Token, NFT) are hosted on the chain, while the rest of user data are hosted in the centralized cloud, which not only increases the risk of monopoly, but also greatly reduces the resistance to censorship.

b) Blockchain network interaction speed is slow, sending messages need to wait for block confirmation before the other party can receive them, and there is even the possibility of sending failure

c) The GAS fee is too high. Sending a message or Like a post needs to consume 100 dollars in gas fees when network congestion
