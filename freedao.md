# FreeDAO

In terms of community governance, Freedom has built a DAO governance incentive model that allows all users of the platform to change their status from user to co-constructor. The DAO governance incentive model also provides users with a sound economic system in which they can hold NFT/tokens to gain governance rights, determine the future development of the platform, and even participate in decisions about on-chain governance, module expansion, product upgrade iteration and token economics change
