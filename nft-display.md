# NFT Display

In the Freedom social platform, you can bind multiple wallets from multiple chains simultaneously with a FreeID and easily retrieve the NFTs from all bound wallets and display them on the same page. In addition, you can mint NFTs with one-click function through the Freedom platform.

Users can like, share and comment on any NFT held by others. We believe that almost all NFT holders need a stage to show off and that pioneers, key opinion leaders and influencers need a web3.0 Instagram to showcase their hobbies to others.

All your NFT collections will be displayed on your homepage! **you can also consider NFT Display as a one-stop Web3.0 NFT management tool .**

The multi-chain NFT Display is now live, join and show off your NFTs!
