# DFINITY

The Reverse Gas Model built into Internet Computer is very different from the Gas Model used in many blockchain web applications, the mechanism of the Reverse Gas Model is that the DApp developer DApp pays for the Gas (Cycles) to run the smart contract, the user does not have to pay for the Gas when accessing the DApp service. Imagine running Google on Ethereum and having to pay nearly $100 in Gas fees for a single use, which does not fit the scenario of the SocialFi application. Users have a very high demand for interactions when using SocialFi apps, so it is not desirable for SocialFi apps if users have to pay Gas fees for their actions on the network, so we think the Reverse Gas model will be the most important cornerstone of the Freedom platform to bring explosive user growth.ive; it is even possible to write game logic and social protocols in the contract. In addition, the unique features of DFINITY smart contracts (Canisters) allow the contract to increase the throughput and capacity of the application by upgrading itself or creating new Canisters when it needs to expand, which fits well with the vision and mission that the Freedom platform wants to achieve.
